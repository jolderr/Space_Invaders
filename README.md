January 2021 - Present

Language: Java
## Description
Currently implementing the classic game of space invaders in java. This game originally started as a school assignment, but it has been continuously worked on and improved. Utilizing multi-threading and object-oriented programming, the game implements player movement, enemy spawning/crawl, bullet firing, and continuous hit detection.

## Status
The game works, with the features listed in the description working as intended. There are a few features that are currently being implemented.

Current TODO:
* Implement a more efficient hit detection algorithm.
* Add sound effects(bullet firing, enemy kill, game over)
* Add background music


Future TODO:
* Difficulty choice
* Alternative enemy movement
